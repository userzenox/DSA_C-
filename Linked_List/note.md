1. -> Operator
- Purpose: The -> operator is used to access members (variables or functions) of a class through a pointer to an object.
- Usage:Node* node = new Node(10); // 'node' is a pointer to a Node object
node->data = 20;          // Access the 'data' member using '->'
In this example:- node is a pointer to the object.
- -> is used to access the member data of the object that node points to.

- How it works: It effectively dereferences the pointer and accesses the member in a single step. Using node->data is equivalent to writing (*node).data.


2. this-> Pointer
- Purpose: this-> is specifically used within non-static member functions of a class. The keyword this is a pointer that refers to the


class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    void setData(int data) {
        this->data = data; // 'this->' refers to the object's own 'data'
    }
};






Key Differences
| Aspect | -> | this-> | 
| Context | Used with a pointer to an object. | Used inside non-static member functions. | 
| Purpose | Access members of an object via a pointer. | Access members of the current object. | 
| Usage | Requires a pointer to the object. | Refers to the current object automatically. | 
| Example | node->data | this->data | 




- Use -> when you’re dealing with a pointer to an object from outside the class.
- Use this-> inside a class when you want to explicitly refer to the current object’s members.
